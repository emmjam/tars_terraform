    # TF-UPGRADE-TODO: In Terraform v0.10 and earlier, it was sometimes necessary to

    # in an extra set of list brackets. That form was supported for compatibility in
    # v0.11, but is no longer supported in Terraform v0.12.
    #
    # If the expression in the following list itself returns a list, remove the
    # brackets to avoid interpretation as a list of lists. If the expression
    # returns a single list item then leave it as-is and remove this TODO comment.
