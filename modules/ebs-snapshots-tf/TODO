# TODO: peacheym:
#
# I am not touching this right now because it appears to be functioning
# however this module has been taken from the wrong place and is not the
# expected configuration. The correct module should not make any use
# of the "archive" terraform provider.
#
# Additionally the call to this module passes in a list variable,
# but when doing so it passes in a single string value, which is a
# comma separated list.
#
# I recommend someone getting on top of this and working it out,
# or at the earliest convenience provided by terraform support for it,
# migrate to the AWS snapshot scheduling service.
